## Practical 9

This folder contains the header file magic_square.h and a main.c file, as well as two text files, magic_square.txt and not_magic_square.txt. When compiled, this code is able to tell whether a square matrix is magic or not, i.e. if the sum of numbers in each row, column and diagonals are all the same number.

## Compile

* gcc main.c -o main

## Execute

./main.c

## Input

Enter file name: 

## Output

* If input is magic_square.txt

No. lines, 3
This square is magic. 

* If input is not_magic_square.txt

No. lines, 3
This square is NOT magic.
